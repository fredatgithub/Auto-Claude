Merge AI System
===============

Intent-aware merge system for multi-agent collaborative development.

This module provides semantic understanding of code changes and intelligent
conflict resolution, enabling multiple AI agents to work in parallel without
traditional merge conflicts.

Components:
- SemanticAnalyzer: Tree-sitter based semantic change extraction
- ConflictDetector: Rule-based conflict detection and compatibility analysis
- AutoMerger: Deterministic merge strategies (no AI needed)
- AIResolver: Minimal-context AI resolution for ambiguous conflicts
- FileEvolutionTracker: Baseline capture and change tracking
- MergeOrchestrator: Main pipeline coordinator

Usage:
    from merge import MergeOrchestrator

    orchestrator = MergeOrchestrator(project_dir)
    result = orchestrator.merge_task("task-001-feature")
